# Experiments

This directory contains the jupyter notebooks which started the whole project. In one of the notebook, I fiddle around with [jira](https://jira.readthedocs.io/en/master/) library and learn and showcase what it does, and how we can work with it. In the other notebook, I try doc2Vec as well as TfIdf for JIRA tickets and see which one performs better.
